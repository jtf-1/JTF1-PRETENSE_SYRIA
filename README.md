DYNAMIC DECK TEMPLATES
======================

Application and removal of Dynamic Deck Templates is available in the F10|Other|JTF-1 menu under "Dynamic Deck". Complete and partial templates can be applied to supported ships. 

Complete templates contain a full set of static objects for Launch or Recovery. If a Complete template is applied all existing statics will be cleared from the deck first.

Partial templates can be added to or subtracted from a clear deck or a deck containing other partial templates. Partial templates cannot be added to, or removed from, a Complete template that has already been applied.

The "Clear Deck" command will remove all statics from the deck.
